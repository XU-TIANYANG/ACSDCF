Instruction for ACSDCF Tracker:
Adaptive Channel Selection for Robust Visual Tracking with Discriminative Correlation Filters (ACSDCF) utilises adaptive channel selection method
to train low-dimensional discriminative correlation filters. 

Dependencies:
MatConvNet, PDollar Toolbox, mtimesx and mexResize. 

Installation:
Run install.m file to compile the libraries.
Download deep extractor from http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/models/imagenet-resnet-50-dag.mat
Edit setup_paths.m to set involved paths.
configure ACSDCF for OTB benchmark or VOT toolkit using run_ACSDCF.m or run_ACSDCF_HC.m 

Operating system:
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Matlab R2016a, CPU Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5-2643
